RELEASE NOTES FOR WIS GO7007SB LINUX DRIVER
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Last updated: 5 November 2005

 - Release 0.9.7 includes new support for using udev to run fxload.  The
   install script should automatically detect whether the old hotplug
   scripts or the new udev rules should be used.  To force the use of
   hotplug, run "make install USE_UDEV=n".  To force the use of udev, run
   "make install USE_UDEV=y".

 - Motion detection is supported but undocumented.  Try the `modet` app
   for a demonstration of how to use the facility.

 - Using USB2.0 devices such as the TV402U with USB1.1 HCDs or hubs can
   cause buffer overruns and frame drops, even at low framerates, due to
   inconsistency in the bitrate control mechanism.

 - On devices with an SAA7115, including the Plextor ConvertX, video height
   values of 96, 128, 160, 192, 256, 320, and 384 do not work in NTSC mode.
   All valid heights up to 512 work correctly in PAL mode.

 - The WIS Star Trek and PCI Voyager boards have no support yet for audio
   or the TV tuner.
